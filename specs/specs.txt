PROMOTIONS:

There are two types of promotions: 
 Normal: users can buy straight away products and collect them. There is no time window. Stores should publish items with a already market disccount into consideration (motivates users to consume via the app and use the app)

When user clicks on Promotions/Offers (tbc) the user has to select the store and then all the items associated to that store will be displayed
then the user can select an item and create the offer for that item assocaited to that store.



 Bulk: This is a type of offer. Business decide how many units want to sell in bulk and how much discounts they want to apply based on qty of users subscribed to the offer
 The offer has expiration time to join. Once the time is completed, users can go and collect/consume the product/service. The final price will be re-calculated
 at the end of the offer. The initial price should also contain a initial discount compared to the market/normal offfer/type of sale.

qty of items available (qtyAvailable) : quantity of items currently available for sale. When the offer is created, this number is = to qty.
